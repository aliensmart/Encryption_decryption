# Encryption_decryption
Python does not come with message encryption module so to be able to use encryption we have to install third party library 
to do so...

```
$ pip install cryptography`
```

And go to your console and type 

```
python3
```
```
import cryptography
```
if you import it and enter you can find out if cryptography has been installed successfully or not if it not installed successfully you will get an error message after you hit enter
